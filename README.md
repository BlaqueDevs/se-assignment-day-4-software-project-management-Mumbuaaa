## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Ans:
Waterfall follows a strict, linear process where one phase must be completed before moving on to the next while agile breaks the project into smaller chunks (sprints) that are continuously developed and refined.

Waterfall:
Advantages:
Well-defined structure: Waterfall is ideal for projects with clear requirements that are unlikely to change.
Easier to manage: Since everything is planned in advance, it’s easier to estimate timelines, costs, and resource needs.
Documentation: Heavy documentation ensures that all stakeholders understand the project requirements.
Disadvantages:
Inflexibility: Once a phase is completed, it’s difficult to make changes. This can be problematic if requirements change.
Late Testing: Testing is typically done late in the project, meaning issues are discovered after significant resources have already been invested.
Delays in Feedback: Feedback from users or clients may come too late to influence earlier project decisions.

Agile:
Advantages:
Flexibility: Agile allows changes to be made at any point in the project based on feedback.
Early Delivery: Delivering small, functional pieces of software (MVP) helps to meet immediate needs and improve user satisfaction.
Continuous Feedback: Agile encourages regular client interaction, ensuring the end product aligns with expectations.
Disadvantages:
Less Predictable: The flexible nature of Agile can make it hard to predict costs and timelines upfront.
Requires More Engagement: Agile needs continuous client involvement, which may be difficult if stakeholders don’t have time.
Scope Creep: The iterative approach can sometimes lead to scope creep if changes are not managed carefully.


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
When Agile is More Beneficial:
Projects with Changing Requirements: Agile is ideal for projects where the requirements are likely to evolve or are not well-defined at the start. For example, a mobile app development project where user feedback shapes new features.
Example:
E-commerce Platform Development: For developing an e-commerce platform with frequent feature additions, Agile allows for iterative releases, enabling testing of features like payment integration or customer reviews early on.
When Waterfall is More Beneficial:
Well-Defined Projects: Waterfall works best when the requirements are well-understood from the start, and minimal changes are expected. For example, a construction project management system where every stage is clearly defined and documented.
Example:
Banking Software Development: For developing core banking software, where requirements are typically well-defined and the scope for change is minimal, Waterfall is preferred.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods for Ensuring Quality Assurance (QA):
Code Reviews: Regularly reviewing code ensures that errors are caught early, and best practices are followed.
Automated Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing can be automated to ensure functionality is preserved during development.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Automating the process of integrating and deploying code helps maintain quality by catching bugs early and ensuring smooth deployment.
Importance of Maintaining High Standards:
Client Satisfaction: High-quality software meets client expectations and ensures long-term business relationships.
Cost Reduction: Addressing bugs early in development is cheaper than fixing them post-launch.
